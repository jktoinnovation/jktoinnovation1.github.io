                            require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that
                            operates websites collecting personally identi¡able information from California
                            consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
                            information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to
                            comply with this policy.
